# hello-world
Just another repository.

Branching helps you manage your workflow in an environment where you can try new ideas for the project you are working on. A branch comes off of the master branch, and it is a place where you can work without affecting your main program. 
A commit is a transparent history of whenever you add, edit, or delete part of your work so other people understand what you did and why you did it. It can also let you roll back a change if there is a bug or if you want to change the direction you were working in. Adding commits keeps track of your progress when working on your feature branch. 
A pull request was designed to encourage and capture communication to improve your branch or program. Anyone can see a pull request and exactly what changes would merge into the branch if the request is accepted.
